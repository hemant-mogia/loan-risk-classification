Loan Risk Classification

Overview
The Loan Risk Classification project is designed to predict the risk of loan approval based on various features provided in the dataset. 
This project employs machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that classifies loan applications as either 'Approved' or 'Declined'.

The project includes:

--Data loading and preprocessing
--Feature engineering and selection
--Model training and evaluation
--Reporting and visualization
--Model saving for future use
